Combining technical precision and innovation, the art of the cabinotiers of Saint-Gervais has contributed to the distinction of Geneva. Since the 18th century, the word 'cabinotier' has grouped together the trades related to watchmaking, such as case assemblers, guillocheurs, engravers, setters, gilders, and enamelers. They worked at home or in tiny 'cabins' under the roofs of houses.",
